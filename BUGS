If compilation fails with this error:

error: 'KUrl::operator QString() const' is private

it means that your kconfig is buggy and tries to return QString objects for KUrl settings.

You have to ways to solve this:

1. Patch your KConfig to fix this bug (see https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/107716/).

2. Fix KConfig wrong generated code by hand following this steps:

   - Run make, it will fail with error above.
   - After it fails, edit settingsadaptor.h and settingsadaptor.cpp
     and change url() method return type from QString to KUrl.
   - Run make again.
